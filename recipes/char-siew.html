    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Char siu is Chinese restaurant-style pork with a deep red, sweet and 
        sticky coating. Char siu literally means "fork roast" and refers to the 
        traditional method of cooking this dish by which strips of seasoned 
        pork were skewered with long forks and roasted in a covered oven or 
        over a fire. This version uses pork tenderloin and is easy to make at 
        home on your charcoal grill. Enjoy the sweet and salty taste on its own 
        or serve it over rice or noodles.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Marinade:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup honey</li>
        <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup Chinese rice wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red bean curd (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pork:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>Stir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin 
                sauce, red bean curd, and five-spice powder together in a 
                saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until just 
                combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>Meanwhile, slice each pork tenderloin lengthwise into 1 1/2- to 
                2-inch-thick strips. Place pork strips in a large, resealable 
                plastic bag.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 3</strong>
            <p>Pour marinade into the bag with the pork. Squeeze air from the 
                bag, seal, and turn the bag a few times until pork is well 
                coated. Marinate in the refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 4</strong>
            <p>When ready to cook, preheat a charcoal grill for medium-high 
                heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 5</strong>
            <p>Remove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. 
                Set aside the remaining marinade for basting.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 6</strong>
            <p>Rake the hot coals into two equal piles on opposite sides of 
                the charcoal grate. Add a small container of water to the 
                grate. Place pork strips in the center of the grate for 
                indirect cooking.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 7</strong>
            <p>Cook pork over indirect heat, turning regularly and basting as 
                desired, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the 
                center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 30 minutes 
                or longer.</p>
        </li>
